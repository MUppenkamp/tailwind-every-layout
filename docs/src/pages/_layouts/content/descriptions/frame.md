Use the Frame to enforce a certain aspect ratio on the container.

The aspect ratio is specified using the `aspect` prop class or picked up from the plugin config.

A replaced child element with the tag `img`, `iframe`, `video`, `embed`, `svg` or `canvas` will fill the frame. If you want this behavior for some other element, apply the `frame-l_frame` class to it.
