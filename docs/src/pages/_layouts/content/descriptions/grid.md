Use the Grid if you want a grid of content where elements align to vertical and horizontal rules.

Items have a minimum allowed width (set using the `item-min-w` prop or picked up from the plugin config). Items will wrap as the available width of the container decreases and they shrink beyond the minimum allowed width.
